It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death, but also portrays a subject's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (r\u00e9sum\u00e9), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality."}, "model": "personal_page.person", "pk": 1}]
